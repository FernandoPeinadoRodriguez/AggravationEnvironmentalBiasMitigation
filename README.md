# AggravationEnvironmentalBiasMitigationProspectiveCrimes
Version 1.0.0

This Python program file calculates the optimal crime levels and the optimal punishment levels from the simulations and robutsness checks reported in Peinado, F. (2023) "Aggravation, Environmental Bias and Mitigation of Prospective Crimes."

The code has been run in version 3.9 of Python and uses the function ‘fsolve’ from the ‘scipy.optimize’ library to determine the optimal crime levels and the optimal punishment levels, see equations (3) and (4) in the article. 

This code provides the results in the form of the figures presented in the article using the ‘matplotlib’ library. These figures are automatically saved as .png files in the same directory where this Python program file might be stored.

# Usage
To replicate the outputs presented in the article, simply run the this Python program file.

To perform simulations and robustness checks with different values of the parameters, follow the instructions depicted in steps labeled "# Set of predefined values for sigma, beta, psi, d and rho."
