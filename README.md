# AggravationEnvironmentalBiasMitigation
Version 1.0.2

These Python program files calculate optimal punishment proportionality from the simulations and robutsness checks reported in Peinado, F. (2023) "Aggravation, Environmental Bias and Mitigation of Prospective Crimes."

The code has been run in version 3.9 of Python and provides the results in the form of the figures presented in the article using the ‘matplotlib’ library. These figures are automatically saved as .png files in the same directory where this Python program file might be stored.

# Usage
To replicate the outputs presented in the article, simply run the these Python program files.

To perform simulations and robustness checks with different values of the parameters, follow the instructions depicted in steps labeled "# Set of predefined values for sigma, beta, psi, d and rho."
